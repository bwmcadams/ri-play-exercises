# Exercise 10

## Cache the currency page

Use Play's [cache](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaCache) feature to make the currency page calculate only once per date.

Verify this is working by looking at your logs and checking that the home Action is only evaluated once for each date.

# Exercise 3

## Create a Currency page

Add the `/currency/:date` GET route to your application, which should return the following plain text message:

    TARDIS currency advisor for date <date>

For now, accept any string as a date value.

**Note:** This page is mostly useless now, but it will get much more interesting when we talk about Json and Web Services :)

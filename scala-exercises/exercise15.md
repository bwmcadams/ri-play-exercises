# Exercise 15

## Estimate next maintenance date: 100,000 km or 1 year

Allow operators to calculate when a train needs maintenance again - after it has traveled
100,000 kilometers, or after a year has elapsed since the last maintenance.

The output of this should look something like:

- Train 1 will need maintenance by August 5, 2017 (distance limit)
- Train 5 will need maintenance by June 25, 2017 (time limit)

Where "distance limit"  indicates the reason for the maintenance is the max distance would be
reached by that day, and "time limit" indicates that a year would have passed from the latest
maintenance on that train.

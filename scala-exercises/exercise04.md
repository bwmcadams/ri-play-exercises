# Exercise 4

## Paths can be sorted by total time

Add a utility method to sort the paths you obtained on the previous exercise by total travel time
in ascending mode.

Total travel time includes any waiting time in case of changing trains.

This will help users decide what path to take if they want to minimize the total time spent
traveling.

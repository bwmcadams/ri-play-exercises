# Exercise 9

## List all trains scheduled to run on a specific date

Given a date (no time), I should be able to list all trains that are scheduled to run on that day.

This should consider recurrent schedules and exception dates.

Also provide the opposite functionality: list all trains that are *not* scheduled to run on a
given date.

**Use case**: the Train Operations Department wants to know what trains should be stored and/or are
available for maintenance on a given day.

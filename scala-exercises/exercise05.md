# Exercise 5

## Integrate costing into train paths

Modify your data model to include the dollar value of hops.

Support the possibility of having different trains charge different prices for each hop
(e.g. Train 1 may charge $100 for the Toronto-Ottawa hop, but Train 2 is a luxury train and
will charge $150 for the same hop).

Observe how refactoring your data model affects the rest of your codebase.

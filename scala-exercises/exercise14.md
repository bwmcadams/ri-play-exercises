# Exercise 14

## Calculate train total travel distance

Given all the data you have available (schedules, exceptions, hop distances), calculate how much
distance a given train has traveled from its last maintenance date to a user-provided date.

i.e., I want to know how much distance was covered by Train 1 from its last maintenance date
to December 31, 2018.

You can assume a train magically reappears on its departure station every day, without affecting
the total travel distance.

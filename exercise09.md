# Exercise 9

## Cache the home page

Use Play's [cache](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaCache) feature to make the home page calculate only once.

Verify this is working by looking at your logs and checking that the home Action is only evaluated the first time it's accessed.

# Exercise 14

## Output the expected profit

Add the expected profit to the user when sending back the result of the currency advisor.

For example, if the GBP rate was 8 and is now 5, profit would be calculated as such:

    p = (8 / 5) - 1 = 0.6

which means our dear users could make 60% profit over this one transaction.

Add this number to the plain text response you're sending back to the user.  Your result should look something like this:

_"If you go back to 2001-12-25 you should buy CHF.  You can sell them for a profit of 35.278% when you come back."_
